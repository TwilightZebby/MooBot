# MooBot
A small general-purpose Discord Bot made by TwilightZebby, primarily for Dr1fterX's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/URH5E34FZf), but can be used in other Servers on a case-by-case basis.

# Questions

## What kind of features are there?

> Originally intended to only add Kawaii-bot style Slash Commands (such as `/bonk`, `/boop`, `/headpat`, etc), this Bot has since expanded into a general-purpose Bot to add other features like a Temperature Converter, Button-Role System, and more.
> 
> All of this Bot's features are [listed below](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/MooBot#features-list).


## Why did you make this Bot?

> This Bot was born out from a mixture of "felt like it" and a want to bring back some of the commands from the long-since discontinued Kawaii Bot.
> The Bot, with its original name of "Actions Bot", was originally added to Dr1fterX's Server in January 2021, getting renamed to "MooBot" in March 2022.


## Why did you rename the Bot?

> The original name, "Actions Bot", was picked because of the simple nature of the bot - to add action-based Slash Commands.
> Now that the Bot is being used for more features, which are less action-based (such as the `/potato` command or the Temperature Convertor), TwilightZebby thought a name change was in order since "Actions Bot" isn't accurate anymore.

### Why did you pick "MooBot" as the new name?

> "MooBot" was picked as a reference to an old meme in Dr1fterX's community in which TwilightZebby was a cow. Yes, as in the animal.
> 
> That meme has since long vanished as per TwilightZebby's request, and he would humbly request no one refer to him as a cow anymore. He's a bot now! ;3 


## How many Slash Commands are there/will there be?

> ~~For now TwilightZebby is limiting himself to a maximum of 11.~~
> ~~Even though Discord's API supports up to 100 Guild Slash Commands per Bot per Guild, and another 100 Global Slash Commands per Bot; TwilightZebby is using this lower limit to prevent flooding the Slash Command Interface/GUI :)~~
> 
> ~~*(Well actually the true limit is 62.5k commands per scope, should you account for sub-commands and sub-command groups. But the UI still needs improving for this lol)*~~

> While the above used to be true, Discord's Application Commands system has since started to improve greatly. As such, TwilightZebby is slowly allowing more Slash Commands to be added (but would like to keep below 20 total until the Slash Command List is improved to support hidden and compacted Commands).


## Can I add this Bot to my own Server?

> ~~**No.**~~
> 
> ~~This Bot is only made for use on Dr1fterX's Discord Server. Go search on [top.gg](https://top.gg) or ask on [r/discord_bots](https://www.reddit.com/r/Discord_Bots/) if you want your own Bot like this.~~
>
> As of April 2022, TwilightZebby is allowing this MooBot to be added to other Servers, with limitations (won't add to your Server if I don't know you personally, and won't make a permanent public invite link for this Bot - you'd have to ask TwilightZebby directly for the Bot's invite).

## General Slash Commands
### `/start [channel] [activity]`

### `/potato`
*Starts a game of Hot Potato in the current Text or Thread Channel.*

![Screenshot of the message when the potato command is used to start a Hot Potato game in a Discord Chat](https://i.imgur.com/2gh9agP.png)

- Once a Hot Potato game starts, a Message will be posted in the Channel stating so, along with who started the game, and who was the first User the Potato is passed to.
- To pass the Potato, the current "Hot User" (the one currently hold the Potato) will need to press the "Pass Potato" Button that's attached to the origin message.
- Who the Potato is passed to is picked at random, as long as the User meets the following criteria:
    - The User is NOT a Bot or System User
    - IF IN A TEXT CHANNEL: They are one of the Users who have posted at least one of the last 25 messages in chat (and thus, can be assumed active currently)
    - IF IN A THREAD CHANNEL: They are a Member of the Thread
- The Hot Potato game lasts a random amount of time, maxing out at 5 minutes
- Once the game ends (the Potato 'explodes'), the User last holding the Potato is dubbed the 'loser' of the game.
- Only one Hot Potato game can run at a time per Channel.

### `/rolemenu`

![Screenshot of the info server sub command's response in a Discord Chat](https://i.imgur.com/PVlqorn.png)

‚Ñπ Note: Should the `@everyone` Role __not__ have the `Use External Emojis` Permission, then the emojis to denote Channel Types will be replaced with initials, where:

- T = Text Channels
- N = News/Announcement Channels
- V = Voice Channels
- S = Stage Channels
- C = Categories

This limitation in regards to the `Use External Emojis` Permission is on Discord's side; due to how Slash Command Responses function on Discord (inheriting that permission from the `@everyone` Role), and as such there is nothing TwilightZebby can do other than this workaround. ;-;

#### `/info bot`
*Displays basic information about MooBot itself*

![Screenshot of the info bot sub command's response in a Discord Chat](https://i.imgur.com/Zngxf0E.png)

‚ö† *Currently, all of the text-based commands are developer only, as in, only TwilightZebby can use them. As such, they will not be documentated*
