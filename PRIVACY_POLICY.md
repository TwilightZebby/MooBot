# Actions Bot - Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: 13th November 2021

**Actions Bot** (henseforth "**The Bot**") does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages or User Data without explicit notice.

As of the current iteration, **The Bot** does not store any Messages, and only listens to the `MESSAGE_CREATE` Event from Discord's API for its Developer-only commands to function (such as `a!addgif`, `a!register`, etc). All these commands (except for one) are viewable, as is the rest of **The Bot**'s code, in TwilightZebby's GitHub Repro.

*This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.*
