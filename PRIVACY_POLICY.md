# MooBot - Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: 10th March 2022

**MooBot** (henseforth "**The Bot**") does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages or User Data without explicit notice.

As of the current iteration, **The Bot** does not store any Messages, and only listens to the `MESSAGE_CREATE` Event from Discord's API for its Developer-only commands to function (such as `a!addgif`, `a!register`, etc). All these commands (except for one) are viewable, as is the rest of **The Bot**'s code, in TwilightZebby's GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/TwilightZebby/MooBot ).

The Developer of **The Bot**, TwilightZebby, is contactable via the listed methods below should any queries be asked about **The Bot**:

- GitHub, preferrably via opening an Issue Ticket or Discussion on **The Bot**'s [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/MooBot);
- Discord, by asking TwilightZebby in Dr1fterX's Discord Server ( found at https://discord.gg/URH5E34FZf );
    - Please note, TwilightZebby has his Discord Direct Messages (DM's) disabled unless you are also in one of very few servers that he has them enabled for, hense why this isn't offered as a contact method
    - TwilightZebby's Discord Name: `TwilightZebby#1955`, and Discord User ID: `156482326887530498`
- Twitter, [@TwilightZebby](https://twitter.com/TwilightZebby)

Please also see [Discord's own Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
